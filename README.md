# The Pervasive Impact of Racism

The impact of **racism and discrimination affect entire societies** and international relations. Research consistently demonstrates that racism is not only widespread but worsening in many parts of the world. The World Justice Project finding that 70% of countries experienced increased discrimination between 2021 and 2022, and **three-quarters of studied countries showing rising discrimination since 2015**\[1]. 

Research by Pew Research Center across 17 advanced economies found that majorities in 14 countries recognize racial and ethnic discrimination as a somewhat or very serious problem in their own societies, with particularly high awareness in Italy, France, Sweden, Germany, and the United States. By contrast, fewer than half of respondents in Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan viewed discrimination as a serious domestic issue\[2]. 

### Race
The term "race" as used to group people by ethnicity or complexion originated in the 16th century and evolved over time:

1. 16th century: The word "race" was introduced into English from Old French, initially meaning a group of people with common descent.
2. Late 16th century: First recorded use of "race" to refer to an ethnic group (1572).
3. 18th-19th centuries: The concept of race developed further, becoming increasingly associated with physical characteristics and geographical origins.
4. 19th century: Scientific racism emerged, attempting to classify humans into distinct biological races based on physical traits.
5. Early 20th century: The concept of race became more firmly entrenched in popular and scientific discourse, despite growing criticism.
6. Mid-20th century onwards: The biological concept of race has been largely discredited in scientific circles, with race now understood primarily as a social construct.\[3]

## What is Racism?
The dictionary describes racism as **prejudice or antagonism** toward someone of a different race, based on the belief in one's own race's superiority. Another perspective focuses on institutional racism and the power dynamics that enable individuals to act on their racist beliefs\[4]. 

**Types of Racism**
Racism manifests in various forms, including **internalized racism**, which encompasses *personal prejudices*, and **interpersonal racism**, which involves the *expression of racism* between individuals. **Institutional racism** is characterized by *deeply rooted* historical policies and processes, while **structural racism** involves laws and policies that perpetuate *unfair advantages* or *harm* based on complexion culture or ethnicity\[5].

## Bias
**Explicit bias** involves conscious communication and action which communicate prejiduce, and is the most widely understood variety of racism. **Implicit bias**, is a more broad-reachging concept involving an unconscious attitude or stereotype, can affect an individual's perceptions and actions\[6].

## Colorism
Colorism is a global cultural practice rooted in historical power dynamics that favors lighter skin tones, influencing perceptions and interactions within and between racial groups. This bias is evident in various sectors, from media representation to personal expectations, where lighter-skinned individuals are often perceived more favorably. Research indicates that these biases are deeply ingrained, affecting how individuals are treated and judged from a young age, potentially impacting their educational and economic opportunities.\[7]\[8]\[9]

> a person’s skin color is an irrefutable visual fact that is impossible to hide, whereas race is a constructed, quasi-scientific classification that is often only visible on a government form. - [The Difference Between Racism and Colorism](https://time.com/4512430/colorism-in-america/)

## Systemic Racism
The criminal justice system represents one of the most visible manifestations of systemic racism in many countries. In the United States, Black people constitute approximately 12% of the total population but make up one-third of the prison population, reflecting the highest incarceration rate in the world\[10]. 

This racialized incarceration has facilitated "a historic shift from mental illness being treated in hospitals to being treated in carceral systems," making jails and prisons the largest providers of mental health care in the United States. Even beyond those directly incarcerated, studies reveal that "aggressive policing, such as the killing of unarmed African Americans, leads to declining mental health for the entire Black population in the state in which the incident occurs"\[11].

### Persistence of Systemic Racism
Cultural racism makes the preferential treatment of dominant groups seem natural and appropriate rather than discriminatory. This normalization occurs when "one group of people and their values, ways of doing things are classified as 'normal' and other groups of people are 'abnormal'"\[11]. (See also Othering)

Through media representations, educational curricula, and other cultural products, racial hierarchies become embedded in collective consciousness, providing ideological justification for continued discrimination. **Cultural racism also facilitates internalized racism**, whereby members of marginalized groups incorporate negative racial stereotypes into their self-concept, causing additional psychological harm\[12]. 

Addressing systemic racism therefore requires intervention at all three levels—**institutional** reforms, **interpersonal** education, and **cultural** transformation—to dismantle the interconnected mechanisms that sustain racial inequality.

## Intersectionality
Intersectionality recognizes that various forms of oppression, such as those based on race, class, and gender, are interconnected, creating unique experiences of discrimination for individuals. This framework, coined by [Kimberlé Crenshaw](https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/kimberle-w-crenshaw), highlights the importance of considering all aspects that can marginalize people. Understanding intersectionality is crucial for addressing the complex ways in which biases like colorism affect individuals, particularly women of color, in professional settings.\[13]\[14]

According to UNICEF, racism and discrimination against children based on their ethnicity, language, and religion are widespread in countries across the world, with Indigenous children often facing multiple overlapping disadvantages\[15]. These disparities reflect both historical injustices, such as dispossession and cultural genocide, and ongoing discrimination in access to resources and services.

## Cultural Appropriation
Cultural appropriation involves adopting elements of a culture by members of another culture, often without acknowledgment or respect. It is especially controversial when a dominant culture appropriates from minority cultures, potentially reinforcing power dynamics and harming the marginalized culture. Distinguishing between cultural appreciation and exploitation requires considering context, intention, and whether the original creators receive credit or compensation.\[16]\[17]\[18]

### Othering
Othering is a philosophical concept that refers to the process of viewing or treating individuals or groups as fundamentally different from oneself. Originating from Hegel's work on self-consciousness in the early 19th century, the concept was later developed by philosophers like Sartre and de Beauvoir. 

Othering plays a crucial role in the formation of identity and social relations, often serving as the basis for various forms of discrimination, including racism and sexism. This process has been particularly evident in colonial and imperialist contexts, where it was used to rationalize the subjugation of non-Western peoples.\[19]

### Abolitionist
In its original context, an abolitionist was a person who advocated for the complete elimination of slavery, particularly in the United States during the 18th and 19th centuries. These individuals, such as Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison, worked tirelessly through various means including writing, speaking, and political activism to end the practice of enslaving African Americans and to promote racial equality.

In modern usage, the term abolitionist has broadened to encompass those who advocate for the elimination of various social institutions or practices viewed as oppressive or unjust. This can include calls for the abolition of prisons, police, border controls, or even capitalism. Modern abolitionists often argue that these systems perpetuate inequality and harm marginalized communities, and they work towards creating alternative structures that promote justice and equality.
